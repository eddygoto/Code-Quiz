        Hello there! My name is OAK! People call me the POKEMON PROF! As you
        know this world is inhabited by creatures called POKEMON! For some
        people, POKEMON are pets. Others use them for fights. Myself...I study
        POKEMON as a profession. Today, I've prepared a quiz on POKEMON for
        aspiring trainers such as yourself! Try to answer the following
        questions within the time limit. Keep in mind that incorrect answers
        will penalize your score/time by 15 seconds!
