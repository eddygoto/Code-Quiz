## Code Quiz

homework 4

# Description

This project is a quiz on POKEMON built by yours truly. It required many moving pieces including: a homepage, a working quiz, a timer, a time penalty for missing a question, an endscreen with a highscore submission, and a highscore page where highscores could be stored and reset in the local memory. I found this project to be incredibly challenging. I initally attempted to create the entire application on a single html file - but that method proved to be unsuccessful. Instead, I gravitated towards and finally decided on creating multiple different html files that the user would navigate through through the available on-screen buttons. Luckily, I also ended up finding a YouTuber that had created a similar project, who had also decided to format his project much like I did, so I was able to learn how to build the quiz's functionality with their help. This project also required me to venture deep into W3 Schools's various tutorial pages, since I felt my overall understanding of JavaScript was lacking. However, I would say this project mainly helped me learn how to break down an assignment into multiple pieces. I was initally overwhelmed at the scope of the project, but before long I was able to focus on each individual part and build from there.
